# Community

## The community is one of R’s best features

Just take a look at the many open-source textbooks that are out there or the millions of excellent answers to questions on Stack Overflow

A thriving community offers developers, expertise, collaborators, writers and documentation, testers, agitators (to keep the community and software on track!), **learners willing to make mistakes and ask tons of questions**, and so much more.

## Pair Programming:

This course intersperses lectures with exercises, which I highly suggest you work on in pairs.

Everyone has unique skill sets, this gives everyone a chance to learn from everyone else. 

## Roles in pair programming

One partner does the typing (*the driver*) 

The other partner (*the navigator*) is suggesting, error-correcting, and strategizing.

The pair both works and learns more effectively.
(This has been studied in many classrooms and has also been involved in the success of many major tech companies).

## Goals of pair programming

- Practice hands-on programming.
- Practice reading, understanding, and debugging other’s code. 
- Try things and don't be afraid to make errors.
- Everyone makes errors, writing a successful script is about learning from those errors.
- Learning is a journey, having a buddy makes it more fun. 


# Learning


## What can we do to improve learning?

Collectively in groups of 3-4: 

- Personal actions: What can you do to be successful?
- Teaching actions: What can I do to help you be successful? 

Report back to large group: top personal actions, top teaching action

## Math and computer anxiety is very common 

::: {.incremental}

How can we manage it?

- Shift Mindsets: View mistakes as learning tools, celebrate progress.
- Build Confidence: Break down concepts, master basics, celebrate "aha!" moments.
- Active Learning: Participate, discuss, use hands-on activities, real-world examples, & technology.
- Manage Stress: Learn relaxation techniques for when frustration and anxiety creep up. 
- Seek Support: Utilize tutors, study groups, & academic support services.

## Expectations

::: {.incremental}

- Read: While we are trying to add more videos, a lot of the course material is text. Read it. If you find helpful videos share them. 
  - Start today with the Welcome and Syllabus.
- Practice: Work through the concept check and problem set assignments.
- Ask questions: If you have a question chances are many others do too. Ask and we will all learn together.
